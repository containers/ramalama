# Sample Markdown File

This is a sample markdown file for testing the file upload functionality.

## Features

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- Lists with bullets
- Code blocks: `inline code`
- Links: [Example](https://example.com)

## Code Example

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return "Success"
```

This file should be processed by the TXTFileUpload class since markdown is treated as text.

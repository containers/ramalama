# Contributing to RamaLama

We'd love to have you join the community!
Below summarizes the processes that we follow.

## Topics

* [Reporting Issues](#reporting-issues)
* [Working On Issues](#working-on-issues)
* [Contributing To RamaLama](#contributing-to-ramalama-1)
* [Submitting Pull Requests](#submitting-pull-requests)
* [Communications](#communications)
* [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)


## Reporting Issues

Before reporting an issue, check our backlog of [open issues](https://github.com/containers/ramalama/issues) to see if someone else has already reported it.
If so, feel free to add your scenario, or additional information, to the discussion.
Or simply "subscribe" to it to be notified when it is updated.
Please do not add comments like "+1" or "I have this issue as well" without adding any new information.
Instead, please add a thumbs-up emoji to the original report.

Note: Older closed issues/PRs are automatically locked.
If you have a similar problem please open a new issue instead of commenting.

If you find a new issue with the project we'd love to hear about it!
The most important aspect of a bug report is that it includes enough information for us to reproduce it.
To make this easier, there are three types of issue templates you can use.
* If you have a bug to report, please use *Bug Report* template.
* If you have an idea to propose, please use the *Feature Request* template.
* If your issue is something else, please use the default *Blank issue* template.

Please include as much detail as possible, including all requested fields in the template.
Not having all requested information - for example, a full `ramalama info` - makes it much harder to find and fix issues.
A reproducer is the best thing you can include.
Reproducers make finding and fixing issues much easier for maintainers.
The easier it is for us to reproduce a bug, the faster it'll be fixed!

Please don't include any private/sensitive information in your issue!
Security issues should NOT be reported via Github and should instead be reported via the process described [here](https://github.com/containers/common/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Working On Issues

Once you have decided to contribute to RamaLama by working on an issue, check our backlog of [open issues](https://github.com/containers/ramalama/issues) looking for any that are unassigned.
If you want to work on a specific issue that is already assigned but does not appear to be actively being worked on, please ping the assignee in the issue and ask if you can take over.
If they do not respond after several days, you can notify a maintainer to have the issue reassigned.
When working on an issue, please assign it to yourself.
You can use the `/assign` bot command in a comment on an issue to assign it to yourself.
If you lack permissions to do so, you can ping the `@containers/ramalama-maintainers` group to have a maintainer set you as assignee.

## Contributing To RamaLama

This section describes how to make a contribution to RamaLama.

### Prepare your environment

The minimum version of Python required to use RamaLama is Python 3.8

### Fork and clone RamaLama

First, you need to fork this project on GitHub.
Then clone your fork locally:
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:<you>/ramalama
$ cd ./ramalama/
```

### Using the Makefile

RamaLama uses a Makefile for common actions such as compiling RamaLama, building the documentation, linting or executing unit tests.

You can list available actions by using:
```shell
$ make help
Usage: make <target>
...output...
```

### Install required tools

The Makefile allows you to install needed development tools (e.g. the linter):
```shell
$ make install-requirements
```

### Building docs

To build RamaLama's manpages, you can run `make docs`.
Built documentation will be placed in the `docs/` directory.
Markdown versions can be viewed in the `docs/` directory.

### Setting up Podman Farm to build Multi-Arch Images

Some of the RamaLama images are intended to run on aarch64 as well as x86_64, e.g., `ramalama` & `vulkan`.

Podman Farm is a great tool for building multi-arch image manifests.  Docs here - [Podman Farm](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-farm.1.html)

To set up `podman farm` you need to first have `podman` installed on systems with the desired build architectures.

1. Start the podman socket listener on all systems.

   ```bash
   systemctl enable podman --now
   ```

1. Create an `ssh` trust between your workstation and the other systems:

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id <user>@<hostname>
   ```

1. Create a podman farm:

   ```bash
   podman farm create <farm-name>
   ```

1. Create a podman system connection to the remote host and add it to the podman farm:

   ```bash
   podman system connection add <connection-name> <user>@<hostname>
   podman farm update <farm-name> --add <connection-name>
   ```

   __Note:__ use the same <user> for the connection that you used to set up the SSH trust.

1. Once you have added all of the desired connections to your podman farm, you can now build a multi-arch image.

   ```bash
   podman login <registry-of-choice>
   podman farm build -t <registry-of-choice>/<image-name> -f path/to/Containerfile ./path/
   ```

Example using an Apple Silicon based machine as the workstation, and an Intel Linux machine as a remote host with IP 10.11.12.13:

1. Set up Podman Farm -

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id <your-linux-user-id>@10.11.12.13
   podman machine init -m 8192 # Give the machine plenty of RAM
   podman machine start
   podman farm create ramalama
   podman farm update ramalama --add podman-machine-default # Add the local podman system to the farm
   podman system connection add x86_64 <your-linux-user-id>@10.11.12.13 # Add a podman system connection to the remote host
   podman farm update ramalama --add x86_64 # Add the remote host to the farm
   ```
1. Build a multi-arch image

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/containers/ramalama.git
   cd ramalama
   podman login quay.io
   podman farm build -t quay.io/<your-quay-user-id>/ramalama/vulkan -f container-images/vulkan/Containerfile ./container-images
   ```

## Testing

RamaLama provides an extensive suite of regression tests in the `test/` directory.
All pull requests should be accompanied by test changes covering the changes in the PR.
Pull requests without tests will receive additional scrutiny from maintainers and may be blocked from merging unless tests are added.
Maintainers will decide if tests are not necessary during review.

### Types of Tests

There are several types of tests run by RamaLama's upstream CI.
* Build testing (including cross-build tests, and testing to verify each commit in a PR builds on its own)
* Python format/lint checking
* Unit testing
* System testing (again, run on several operating systems, root and rootless)

### Python Format and lint

All code changes must pass `make validate`.

### System Tests

The system tests are written in Bash using the BATS framework.
They are intended to validate RamaLama builds before they are shipped by distributions.

The system tests are located in the `test/system/` directory.

## Documentation

Make sure to update the documentation if needed.
RamaLama is primarily documented via its manpages, which are located under `docs`.
There are a number of automated tests to make sure the manpages are up to date.
These tests run on all submitted pull requests.
Full details on working with the manpages can be found in the [README](https://github.com/containers/ramalama/blob/main/docs/README.md) for the docs.

## Submitting Pull Requests

No Pull Request (PR) is too small!
Typos, additional comments in the code, new test cases, bug fixes, new features, more documentation, ... it's all welcome!

While bug fixes can first be identified via an "issue" in Github, that is not required.
It's ok to just open up a PR with the fix, but make sure you include the same information you would have included in an issue - like how to reproduce it.

PRs for new features should include some background on what use cases the new code is trying to address.
When possible and when it makes sense, try to break-up larger PRs into smaller ones - it's easier to review smaller code changes.
But only if those smaller ones make sense as stand-alone PRs.

Regardless of the type of PR, all PRs should include:
* Well-documented code changes, both through comments in the code itself and high-quality commit messages.
* Additional tests. Ideally, they should fail w/o your code change applied.
  (With a few exceptions, CI hooks will block your PR unless your change
  includes files under the `test/` subdirectory. Repo
  admins may bypass this restriction by setting the 'No New Tests' GitHub
  label on the PR).
* Documentation updates to reflect the changes made in the pull request.

Squash your commits into logical pieces of work that might want to be reviewed separate from the rest of the PRs.
Squashing down to just one commit is also acceptable since in the end the entire PR will be reviewed anyway.
When in doubt, squash.

When your PR fixes an issue, please note that by including `Fixes: #00000` in the commit description.
More details on this are below, in the "Describe your changes in Commit Messages" section.

The RamaLama repo follows a one-ack policy for merges.
PRs will be approved by an [approver][owners] listed in [`OWNERS`](OWNERS).
They will then be merged by a repo owner.
Two reviews are required for a pull request to merge, including SourceAI

### Describe your Changes in Commit Messages

Describe your problem.
Whether your patch is a one-line bug fix or 5000 lines of a new feature, there must be an underlying problem that motivated you to do this work.
Convince the reviewer that there is a problem worth fixing and that it makes sense for them to read past the first paragraph.

Describe user-visible impact.
Straight up crashes and lockups are pretty convincing, but not all bugs are that blatant.
Even if the problem was spotted during code review, describe the impact you think it can have on users.
Keep in mind that the majority of users run packages provided by distributions, so include anything that could help route your change downstream.

Quantify optimizations and trade-offs.
If you claim improvements in performance, memory consumption, stack footprint, or binary size, include
numbers that back them up.
But also describe non-obvious costs.
Optimizations usually aren’t free but trade-offs between CPU, memory, and readability; or, when it comes to heuristics, between different workloads.
Describe the expected downsides of your optimization so that the reviewer can weigh costs against
benefits.

Once the problem is established, describe what you are actually doing about it in technical detail.
It’s important to describe the change in plain English for the reviewer to verify that the code is behaving as you intend it to.

Solve only one problem per patch.
If your description starts to get long, that’s a sign that you probably need to split up your patch.

If the patch fixes a logged bug entry, refer to that bug entry by number and URL.
If the patch follows from a mailing list discussion, give a URL to the mailing list archive.
Please format these lines as `Fixes:` followed by the URL or, for Github bugs, the bug number preceded by a #.
For example:

```
Fixes: #00000
Fixes: https://github.com/containers/RamaLama/issues/00000
Fixes: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-00000
Fixes: RHEL-00000
```

However, try to make your explanation understandable without external resources.
In addition to giving a URL to a mailing list archive or bug, summarize the relevant points of the discussion that led to the patch as submitted.

If you want to refer to a specific commit, don’t just refer to the SHA-1 ID of the commit.
Please also include the oneline summary of the commit, to make it easier for reviewers to know what it is about. If the commit was merged in Github, referring to a Github PR number is also a good option, as that will retain all discussion from development, and makes including a summary less critical.
Examples:

```
Commit f641c2d9384e ("fix bug in rm -fa parallel deletes") [...]
PR #00000
```

When referring to a commit by SHA, you should also be sure to use at least the first twelve characters of the SHA-1 ID.
The RamaLama repository holds a lot of objects, making collisions with shorter IDs a real possibility.
Bear in mind that, even if there is no collision with your six-character ID now, that condition may change five years from now.

The following git config settings can be used to add a pretty format for outputting the above style in the git log or git show commands:

```
[core]
	abbrev = 12
[pretty]
	fixes = Fixes: %h (\"%s\")
```

### Sign your PRs

The sign-off is a line at the end of the explanation for the patch.
Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.
The rules are simple: if you can certify the below (from [developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org/)):

```
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.
660 York Street, Suite 102,
San Francisco, CA 94110 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

Then you just add a line to every git commit message:

    Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`.

### Continuous Integration

All pull requests automatically run RamaLama's test suite.
The tests have been configured such that only tests relevant to the code changed will be run.
For example, a documentation-only PR with no code changes will run a substantially reduced set of tests.
To force a PR to run all tests, you can include the string `[CI:ALL]` in the PR title, but this is almost never necessary.

There is always additional complexity added by automation, and so it sometimes can fail for any number of reasons.
This includes post-merge testing on all branches, which you may occasionally see [red bars on the status graph](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/containers/ramalama/main).

Most notably, the tests will occasionally flake.
If you see a single test on your PR has failed, and you do not believe it is caused by your changes, you can rerun the tests.
If you lack permissions to rerun the tests, please ping the maintainers using the `@containers/ramalama-maintainers` group and request that the failing test be rerun.

If you see multiple test failures, you may wish to check the status graph mentioned above.
When the graph shows mostly green bars on the right, it's a good indication the main branch is currently stable.
Alternating red/green bars is indicative of a testing "flake", and should be examined (anybody can do this):

* *One or a small handful of tests, on a single task, (i.e. specific distro/version)
  where all others ran successfully:*  Frequently the cause is networking or a brief
  external service outage.  The failed tasks may simply be re-run by pressing the
  corresponding button on the task details page.

* *Multiple tasks failing*: Logically this should be due to some shared/common element.
  If that element is identifiable as a networking or external service (e.g. packaging
  repository outage), a re-run should be attempted.

* *All tasks are failing*: If a common element is **not** identifiable as
  temporary (i.e. container registry outage), please seek assistance via
  [the methods below](#communications) as this may be early indication of
  a more serious problem.

In the (hopefully) rare case there are multiple, contiguous red bars, this is
a ***very bad*** sign.  It means additional merges are occurring despite an uncorrected
or persistently faulty condition.  This risks additional bugs being introduced
and further complication of necessary corrective measures.  Most likely people
are aware and working on this, but it doesn't hurt [to confirm and/or try and help
if possible.](#communications).

## Communications

If you need help, you can contact the maintainers using the channels mentioned in RamaLama's [communications](https://github.com/containers/ramalama/blob/main/README.md#community) document.

#### **--oci-runtime**

Override the default OCI runtime used to launch the container. Container
engines like Podman and Docker, have their own default oci runtime that they
use. Using this option RamaLama will override these defaults.

On Nvidia based GPU systems, RamaLama defaults to using the
`nvidia-container-runtime`. Use this option to override this selection.

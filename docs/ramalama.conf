# The RamaLama configuration file specifies all of the available configuration
# command-line options/flags for container engine tools like Podman & Buildah,
# but in a TOML format that can be easily modified and versioned.

# Please refer to ramalama.conf(5) for details of all configuration options.
# Not all container engines implement all of the options.
# All of the options have hard coded defaults and these options override
# the built in defaults. Users can override these options via the command
# line. Container engines read ramalama.conf files in up to three
# locations in the following order:
#  1. /usr/share/ramalama/ramalama.conf
#  2. /etc/ramalama/ramalama.conf
#  3. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ramalama/ramalama.conf or
#     $HOME/.config/ramalama/ramalama.conf if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set
#  Items specified in the latter ramalama.conf, if they exist, override the
# previous ramalama.conf settings, or the default settings.

# **never**: Never pull the image but use the one from the local containers storage.  Throw an error when no image is found.
# **newer**: Pull if the image on the registry is newer than the one in the local containers storage.  An image is considered to be newer when the digests are different.  Comparing the time stamps is prone to errors.  Pull errors are suppressed if a local image was found.
